This Social Media API is built using Django and Django REST Framework and provides a foundation for user authentication and profile management. To set up the project, clone the repository to your local machine, create and activate a virtual environment, and install the required dependencies including Django and Django REST Framework. After installing the dependencies, apply database migrations to create the necessary tables, including the custom user model and token authentication tables. Once migrations are complete, start the development server to confirm that the application is running correctly.

The API supports user registration and authentication using token-based authentication. When a new user registers, they provide a username, email, and password. Upon successful registration, the system creates the user and automatically generates an authentication token, which is returned in the response. For returning users, the login endpoint verifies the provided credentials and returns an authentication token upon successful authentication. This token must be included in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to access protected endpoints such as the user profile endpoint. Token authentication ensures secure access to user-specific resources.

The project uses a custom user model that extends Django’s built-in AbstractUser class. In addition to the default authentication fields such as username, email, and password, the model includes additional fields like a bio field for user descriptions, a profile picture field for storing user images, and a followers field. The followers field is implemented as a self-referential many-to-many relationship with asymmetrical behavior, meaning that if one user follows another, the relationship does not automatically apply in reverse. This structure accurately reflects real-world social media follow systems and provides a scalable foundation for implementing additional features such as posts, comments, and notifications.
